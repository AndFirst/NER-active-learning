To	win	the	money	,	SpaceShipOne	had	to	blast	off	into	space	twice	in	a	two-week	period	and	fly	at	least	100	kilometers	above	Earth	.
The	spacecraft	made	its	flights	in	late	September	and	early	October	,	lifting	off	from	California	's	Mojave	desert	.
Three	major	banks	have	collapsed	,	unemployment	has	soared	,	and	the	value	of	the	krona	has	plunged	.
The	vehicle	had	to	carry	a	pilot	and	weight	equivalent	to	two	passengers	.
SpaceShipOne	was	financed	with	more	than	$	20	million	from	Paul	Allen	,	a	co-founder	of	the	Microsoft	Corporation	.
North	Korea	says	flooding	caused	by	last	week	's	typhoon	,	Wipha	,	has	destroyed	14,000	homes	and	1,09,000	hectares	of	crops	.
The	state	news	agency	KCNA	reported	the	damage	Monday	.
